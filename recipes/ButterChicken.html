    <h1>Butter Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato,
        butter, and a special spice blend as a base.
    </p>
      <p>
        Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil,
        butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter,
        giving it a slightly sweet flavor.
        Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish
        </p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <strong><li>Marinate the chiken:</li></strong>
            <p>Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.</p>
            <p>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</p>
            <strong><li>Soak cashews and almonds:</li></strong>
            <p>Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the recipe.</p>
            <strong><li>Cook the chicken:</li></strong>
            <p>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.</p>
            <p>Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan.</p>
            <p>Once cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later.</p>
            <strong> <li>Start making the sauce:</li></strong>
            <p>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Saut√© for 1 to 2 minutes</p>
            <p>Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.</p>
            <p>Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.</p>
            <strong> <li>Puree the sauce with the nuts:</li></strong>
            <p>Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.</p>
            <strong> <li>Finish the dish:</li></strong>
            <p>Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce. </p>
            <p>As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.</p>
            <strong> <li>Rest the butter chicken:</li></strong>
            <p>Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.</p>
            <strong> <li>Serve:</li></strong>
            <p>Serve the butter with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for five days.</p>
